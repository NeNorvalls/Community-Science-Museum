        <h1>Welcome to the Community Science Museum</h1>
        <p>"Explore together"</p>
        <p>Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we're committed to making science accessible to all.</p>
        <p>Over the course of human history, science has developed fromour early understanding of fire,
          wind, water, and earth to exploring from the galaxies far away to the very building blocks of
          life itself.</p>
        <p>The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience the wonders of our
          discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world
          around us.</p>
        <p>We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought to live through exhibits.</p>
