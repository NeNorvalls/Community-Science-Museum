                <div class="cosmo-p-container">
                    <p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, 'The Sky Above Us', explores the night
                       sky and what we can see and know about the universe around us. We'll locate the various constellations
                       and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to 
                       travel by.</p>
                    <p>Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileo's telescope, to 
                       the latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.</p>

            <h2>Evolutions</h2>
                <img src="images/evolutions.jpg" alt="human evolution">

               <div class="evo-p-container">
                   <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where do we
                      come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring
                      and understanding our place in this world.</p>
                   <p>Discover the origins of life onthis planet and how the species we know today have evolved our time. You
                      can also take some time tomeet a few of the creatures who didn't survive, including our Wolly Mammoth,
                      the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.</p>
               </div>   
  
            <h2>Biology and Medicine</h2>
               <img src="images/biology-medicine.jpg" alt="body">

               <div class="bio-p-container">
                   <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique insights into the 
                      great wonders of the tiny world.</p>
                   <p>For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth
                      of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take
                      a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the fisrt heart transplant.</p>
                   <p>Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only fromthe lab, but also from observing animals in 
                      the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.</p>
               </div>
  
            <h2>Robotics and AI</h2>
               <img src="images/Robotics.jpg" alt=" AI robot">

               <div class="robot-p-container">
                   <p>The information revolution is here and the robotics and artificial intelligence are the science of the future.</p>
                   <p>From useful home applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is here. You can even say hello 
                      and shake the hand of Rob the robot.</p>

            <h2>Ecology</h2>
               <img src="images/ecology.jpg" alt="green earth">

               <div class="eco-p-container">
                   <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet,the more important it becomes
                      that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future notjust forhumans but for the whole planet.</p>
                   <p>In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face including global warming,
                      extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all contribute to
                      a brighter future.</p>
